Not long after the move however, Charlene lost her baby brother, Roger...a tragedy that impacted the family's early years in a new home in a new state so far from relatives and friends..
Both sets of parents discouraged a college wedding, not due to their choice of spouses, but because they knew how tough it would be for two ""kids"" to have an enduring marriage..
Both Charlene and Gordon were only 19 years old, but they persevered and saved $1000 between them (a tough goal in 1953), the requirement stipulated by the parents..
Charlene tried to balance her college classes with motherhood, and that slowed her progress toward a degree in Education..
Her faith in Christ was always at the forefront of her motives, love, counsel and support of her husband, as well as ways to nurture and encourage children ...her own and others..
Her son and two daughters are avid readers, largely because Charlene read so many books to them while encouraging them to read on their own..
Beyond her home, Charlene mentored countless young women, wives and mothers according to scripture's admonition for older women to mentor younger ones according to the Bible's instruction on relationships, marriage, abortion, children and much more..
Her knowledge and use of scripture allowed her to lead devotionals when asked, as with the ""Morton Sisterhood,"" a unique gathering of some 29 female descendants and in-laws of Ed & Theodosia Morton..
